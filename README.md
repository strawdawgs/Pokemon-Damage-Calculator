# Pokemon-Damage-Calculator
A Pokemon damage calculator based on generation 3's Fire Red and Leaf Green

This project is based on Pokemon Showdown's damage calculator.

I obtained information on the damage equation, move stats, item stats, abilities, natures and other things online at these websites:
1. Bulbapedia
2. Dragonflycave
3. Serebii

I decided that I wanted to limit the use of Strings in my code, therefore limited user error. To accomplish this, I used the ENUM class
to set the basis for certain inputs such as moves, items, natures, etc. 

I also used Hashmaps as a way to check for super effective, not effective and resistant typings.

I would really like to know where I could improve the program to make it either faster or easier to understand.

P.S. for some odd reason, which might be obvious to someone with better math skills than me, I'm not able to get the exact results
for the possible damage outputs. The results I get are slightly off from the correct possible damages.
